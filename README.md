# HOST MONITORING NOTIFICATION

This project is all about how a attacker or pentest can run a tool on their or compromised network to get notified when any new connection is getting establised to the network so that they can be aware of it and be stealty about their existence.



## Appendix
I have setup to save the results in the memory but you can also send the email also if you are running this script on your network as a secuirty engineering so that if a attracker tries to connect you will be notified.



The results are getting saved in the temporary memory in a linux system but the TEMP_FILE variable can be changed and the temporary memory of the windows or mac OS can also be used.
